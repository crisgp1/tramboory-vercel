## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
1. **TypeScript**: Maintain strict typing throughout migration
2. **Props Interface**: Keep backward compatibility where possible
3. **Performance**: Ensure components perform as well or better than originals
4. **Accessibility**: Maintain or improve accessibility features
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure all components work across device sizes

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual component functionality
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **Visual Tests**: Compare before/after screenshots
4. **User Acceptance Tests**: Verify business functionality works

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Incremental Migration**: Migrate components one at a time
2. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to toggle between old/new components
3. **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to rollback individual components
4. **Staging Testing**: Test thoroughly in staging environment

## Dependencies and Blockers

### External Dependencies
- **Mantine Packages**: Already installed and configured
- **Icon Libraries**: Heroicons (current) and Tabler Icons (optional)
- **Form Libraries**: react-hook-form integration maintained

### Potential Blockers
1. **Custom CSS**: Some custom styling may need adjustment
2. **Theme Integration**: CSS custom properties need migration to Mantine theme
3. **Third-party Components**: Components not using HeroUI are unaffected
4. **Server Components**: Next.js 13+ app directory compatibility

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All existing functionality is preserved
- [ ] No regressions in user experience
- [ ] Performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] All tests pass

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] HeroUI dependencies removed from package.json
- [ ] Bundle size is maintained or reduced
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier rules are satisfied

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Code follows established patterns and conventions
- [ ] Components are accessible and responsive
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Migration is well-documented for future reference

## Monitoring and Rollout

### Staging Deployment
1. Deploy migrated components to staging environment
2. Conduct thorough testing with realistic data
3. Performance testing with production-like load
4. User acceptance testing with stakeholders

### Production Rollout
1. **Blue-Green Deployment**: Deploy alongside existing components
2. **Canary Release**: Gradually route traffic to new components
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor performance and error rates
4. **Quick Rollback**: Ability to rollback individual components if issues arise

### Post-Migration Monitoring
1. **Performance Metrics**: Track page load times and interaction metrics
2. **Error Tracking**: Monitor for new errors or regressions
3. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback on user experience changes
4. **Technical Metrics**: Monitor bundle size and build times

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a systematic approach to migrating from HeroUI to Mantine while maintaining code quality, functionality, and user experience. The phased approach ensures that critical dependencies are migrated first, followed by core functionality, and finally extended features.

The key to success is thorough testing at each phase, maintaining backward compatibility where possible, and having a clear rollback strategy in case of issues.

By following this roadmap, the migration should be completed efficiently with minimal disruption to users and maintainable code for future development.
